# PyGoat: An Intentionally Vulnerable Python Web Application

PyGoat is a Python web application designed to be intentionally vulnerable to security attacks. You can find its source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/eyedee2k/pygoat-tm).

## Mixing Code and User-Provided Data

To mitigate security issues caused by mixing code and user-provided data, consider the following best practices:

1. **Sanitize/Escape Data**: Ensure that all user inputs are properly sanitized or escaped.
2. **Use Standard Functions**: Avoid creating custom solutions. Instead, rely on standard, well-tested functions. For example:
    - Be cautious of vulnerabilities like [htmlspecialchars vulnerability (CVE-2009-4142)](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2009-4142/).

3. **Use Compiled Queries**: Leverage compiled queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
4. **Adopt Domain-Specific Libraries/Frameworks**: Use libraries or frameworks tailored to your domain, such as:
    - [Entity Framework (EF)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/ef.aspx)
    - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

## Testing for Vulnerabilities

You can use tools like [sqlmap](https://sqlmap.org/) to test your application for SQL injection vulnerabilities and other security issues.
